# Accelearate out of the box.

HCL Accelerate is DevOps tool that gathers information across the release lifecycle from different sources. By mapping the movement of tasks it can provide insight on important metrics such as lead time, cycle time, and bottlenecking across your team.

Accelerate suports multiple integrations: Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub, etc. This flexibility allows teams to customize their experience as they see fit. We understan that some of our clients are looking for an out of the box experience, this is why we have created this series of templates to help teams integrate accelerate the smothest and fastest way possible.

In this tutorial we will focus on a github only integration.

## Why Value Stream Management?

Before we begin, lets have some motivation. Why is Value Stream Management important (VSM)? VSM is rooted in the concepts of mapping your organizational processes. This involves working with all major contributing business units (design, development, product management, release engineers, quality assurance, security, etc).


With DevOps tools already in the market, we can levarage their information to give insights on the performance of our team, and lifecyle of our product.

In laymen terms, we breakdown your product into units you can easily track and understan without having to log in to each github, jira,or jenkins dashboard.


# GitHub Set Up

For this tutorial you will need an active github repository and a personal token with a minimum of write priority. If you have trouble creating a personal token follow this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).


Accelerate uses pattern matching to identify which issues are related to wich pull request. Since different teams might have different standards, or none at all, I have suggested to use github issue templates to take care of it. In this case we will be using prefix DOC and BUG to identify what kind of issue we are dealing with.

If you are not familiar with issue templates, you can clone this repository and uses the templates already defined under: [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/danielbarr3ra/AccelerateGitTutorial/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)

# Integration Set Up

Integrations give Accelerate access to your development tools. They are stored under: Setting -> Plugins.

Each integration will have different pattetrns for github we have:

* Integration Name: This integration name will be used later on the linking rules, lets keep it consistent.
* API URL: The current API URL used by github is https://api.github.com
* Owner: when you copy the repository this will be your username.
* Personal access token: the token obtained during github setup.
* repositories: you can add multiple reppositories, in this case its only one.
* branches: you can also observe multiple branches, in this case we are only observing main.

Here is a sample of what the integration set up will look like, if its different you might be on an older version of the release, you can update by clicking on the "check for upgrades button"

# VSM Set Up

Creating a value stream in Accelerate is simple, in the main dashboard you can select "Create New Value Stream Management" and add the title, description and default team:


<p align="center">
  <img width="700" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-25 at 8 42 14" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49797284/165101649-a983e4c3-bb5b-4926-b328-f2f82a3f20a0.png">

</p>

This will bring up the default VSM look which we will modify in the following section.


## JSON

The vsm json file is the rule book for accelerate, in this file you assing all the different stages, linking rules, and integrations.
When edited correctly your VSM dashboard its updated and the right taks will appear and be tracked trhoughtout your pocess.

The JSON file has the following tree strucutre:
* VSM
  * phases
      * stages
  * leadTime
  * cyleTime
  * mappings
  * integrations
  * linkRules
  * metrics
  * metricsBar


## Phases and Stages

Each phase has the following strcutre:
```json
"phases": [
    {
      "name": "Name of the first phase",
      "description": "What does this phase accomplish, planning, develompent?",
      "stages": [
        {
          "name": "Name of the first phase on this stage",
          "query": "This query will pull information from integration",
          "description": "what are the tasks on this stage",
          "targets": [
            "Name of the follwoing stage"
          ],
          "wipLimit": 3,   /*there is a limit of three work in progress items*/
          "gates": null
        },
        {
          "name": "Queue",
          "query": "",
          "description": "",
          "targets": [
            "In Progress"
          ],
          "wipLimit": null,
          "gates": null
        }
      ]
    },
```

## Integrations
After setting up the integration, you can include it ont your vsm file by simply adding the follwing under integration

```json
"integrations": [
   {
    "name":"name used on the integration"
   }
  ],
```

## Queries and Linking Rules.
As noted in the previous section, stages have a query patameter. This query pattameter uses DQL fields to search and filter the different tasks from the data provided by your integration. You can find a full list of thise quries [here](https://devops.hcldoc.com/accelerate/3.0.x/#com.uvelocity.doc/topics/dots_query/#devops-query-language-dql). An example of the queies used in our vsm are the following:


```json
        {
          "name": "Assigned",
          "query": "issue.owner != \"unknown\" and issue.status = \"Open\"  ",
          "description": "These issues have been assigned to a team member",
          "targets": [
            "In Progress"
          ],
          "wipLimit": null,
          "gates": null
       }
        ....
        {
          "name": "In Review",
          "query": "pr.status = open and pr.assignees.count != 0",
          "description": "These pull request have been submited and are actively beeing looked at by other team memebers",
          "targets": [
            "Merged"
          ],
          "wipLimit": 5,
          "gates": null
        },
```
Since pull requests and issues are different items, we need to find a way to link them together and track their process. Accelerate achives this with linking rules. To define a link rule, specify a field in the linked-from tool that you want to associate with a field in the linked-to tool, and a regular expression that defines the matching pattern. 

For github we have the following link rules:
```json
"linkRules": [
    {
      "fromIntegrationName": "SingleGitIntegration",
      "toIntegrationName": "SingleGitIntegration",
      "fromField": "pr.name",
      "toField": "issue.name",
      "pattern": "([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)"
    }
  ],
```
You might recall we previously set up issue templates to adhere to the pattern: "([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)"

## Uploading JSON
We understand setting up everything for the first time can be tideous, if you are on a rush you can upload the vsm file attached in this repo to you value stream. 

Edit Value Stream Map -> Import JSON -> select file to upload.
